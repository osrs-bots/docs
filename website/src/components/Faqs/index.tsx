    question: 'ü¶∫ Are these scripts safe? ',
    answer: 
      <Stack>
        <Typography>
          These bots are designed to interact with the game by detecting pixel locations, rather than accessing the client directly. This makes them less likely to be detected by anti-cheat systems. The bots also mimic human xp rates to avoid suspicion.
        </Typography>
        <Typography pt={'20px'}>
        To further reduce the risk of being banned, it is recommended to switch worlds frequently, follow the bot instructions carefully, and be conscious of runtime.
